# Introduction
Bitcoin is a revolutionary force in today's world, marking the beginning of a revolution. 
Built on blockchain technology, Bitcoin relies on a ledger that records and tracks every 
transaction its users make. With the rise of this alternative, decentralized means of exchange, 
traditional banking practices have not only been challenged but fundamentally altered. 
Fundamentally, Bitcoin is based on a decentralized theory, meaning that no one entity has 
power, giving its user group unmatched transparency and independence. The rise in popularity 
of digital currencies can be caused by Bitcoin. As a result, people's perception of money has 
shifted, presenting opportunities for investors. It's becoming more and more evident that 
Bitcoin has the power to change the global economy as more businesses accept it as payment.
More than just a financial tool, Bitcoin is a symbol of the coming together of technology and 
finance, pointing to a time when digital control over our money becomes not just possible but 
also more commonplace. Its increasing power highlights the need to thoroughly examine its 
trends and actions to fully understand its future course and the scope of its influence on the 
world financial market.
i. Impact of Blockchain Technology
The database known as blockchain, which powers Bitcoin, provides safe and immutable 
record-keeping. This unique approach alters the banking industry by guaranteeing secure and 
transparent transactions without the need for mediators or centralized control. Moreover, the 
core mining process of Bitcoin involves users verifying and validating transactions through 
solving puzzles. This process enhances network security. Incentivizes participation by 
rewarding users with created bitcoins. This self-sustaining ecosystem strengthens the 
foundation of Bitcoin while also advancing its practicality.
ii. Evolving Economic Significance
The rise of Bitcoin has brought about changes in the business world. Organizations, 
from start-ups to large global enterprises, have embraced Bitcoin as a symbol of its potential 
to stay competitive. This widespread adoption has created an environment where new financial 
practices, border transactions, and financial inclusion are being explored and implemented.
Furthermore, the limited supply of 21 million bitcoins has sparked discussions on whether they 
can serve as a hedge against inflation and a reliable store of value.
iii. Imperative of Analysing Bitcoin's Patterns
Because of its unpredictable nature and potential to influence the global financial 
system, it is imperative to analyse Bitcoin's behaviour. A thorough examination of transactional 
data, network connections, market behaviours, and user trends is necessary to gain insights into 
Bitcoin's growth trajectory, possible fluctuations in the market, and more significant 
implications for global financial systems. Network analysis can be performed using advanced 
tools like NetworkX to gain a deeper understanding of Bitcoin's ecosystem. Important 
information on network resiliency, central organizations, and transactional patterns can be 
discovered by carefully examining the network architecture and connectivity between nodes, 
wallets, exchanges, and miners.
Essentially, examining Bitcoin's historical trends provides direction for investors, 
regulators, and stakeholders as they move through the unexplored domains of virtual currencies 
and decentralized banking networks.

# Summary
In this project, we explored the Bitcoin OTC trust network, employing network analysis 
techniques to gain insights into user interactions, ratings, and community structures. The 
analysis began with data pre-processing, where we loaded the Bitcoin OTC dataset, extracted 
relevant information, and constructed a directed graph to represent trust relationships between 
users. Exploring the degree distribution and centrality metrics, such as degree centrality, 
highlighted the structural characteristics of the network. Positive correlations between in-degree and out-degree centrality suggested a network where well-connected nodes tend to 
receive and provide trust in a balanced manner.
The temporal analysis of transactions and user additions over time shed light on the 
network's growth and activity patterns. Understanding the temporal aspects of user interactions 
is crucial for comprehending the dynamics of trust relationships in the Bitcoin OTC network.
Community detection revealed distinct groups within the Bitcoin OTC network. These 
communities likely signify groups of users with shared characteristics or common trust 
patterns. Understanding these communities provided valuable information for identifying 
potential sub-networks with specific user behaviours or transaction patterns.
The analysis delved into user ratings, categorizing nodes based on the sentiment of the 
in and out ratings. This categorization allowed us to identify users receiving predominantly 
positive, negative, or mixed ratings. Examining the distribution of ratings over time provided 
insights into the evolving dynamics of user interactions within the Bitcoin OTC network.
In conclusion, the Bitcoin OTC trust network analysis presented here provides valuable 
insights into the underlying patterns of user trust, community structures, and temporal 
dynamics. The findings contribute to a deeper understanding of trust networks in online 
ecosystems and offer a foundation for future research in this domain
